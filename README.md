# Quarantine Chess GUI
This project contains the graphical version of of our previously created Quaratine Chess which ran solely in the terminal. To create the GUI, we made use of the `Swing` and `AWT` Java Foundational Classes.

# Overview
We wanted to challenge ourselves to learn how to play chess during lockdown, and what better way than to code the entire game from scratch? We're using Object Oriented Programming to model every piece type (the Queen, the King, the Pawn, etc) so that we can use their instances to model the behaviour of each piece with no repeated code. 

# Rules of the Game
Chess is quite a complex game and there have been a lot of new rules introduced since its conception. You can find a link to a basic set of rules and how to play over [here.](https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess)
For a more comprehensive set of rules, you can check out the FIDE Laws of Chess using this [link.](https://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/LawsOfChess.pdf)
